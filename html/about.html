            <br>
            <br>
            Her early exposure to Traditional Polyphonic Singing profoundly influenced her understanding of the voice as a powerful instrument of self-expression. Her passion for music expanded beyond singing, leading her to explore various art forms and mediums, including fashion, dance and film.

            <br>

            Nana assumes complete independence as she writes, records, and produces her own music. Her work extends beyond traditional music production, encompassing a wide range of mediums such as imagery, mixed media, and sonic landscapes. From crafting costumes to directing her own music videos, Nana embraces a multidisciplinary approach, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression.

            Her involvement in Berlin's vibrant artistic community has played a pivotal role in her growth as an artist. Engaging with fellow creatives, organizing events, and collaborating on projects have provided her with invaluable opportunities for self-discovery and artistic exploration.

                    <i>“ As an artist, it is important for me to connect with other creatives in the industry, as I believe that together we can achieve more than we can imagine. Throughout my artistic journey, I have discovered that I learn the most from people, and the choice of sharing knowledge is truly empowering. This is what I cherish about Berlin the most - the abundance of creative individuals who foster a sense of community rather than competition, where egos dissolve and connections are formed to contribute and collaborate.”</i>
