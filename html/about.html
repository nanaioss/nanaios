        <p class="bio-text">
            Multimedia producer <i>Nana Ioseliani</i> AKA <b><i>nana.ios</i></b> were born on August 11, 1996, <i>in Tbilisi, Georgia.</i> From a very young age, Nana distinguished herself as a highly artistic child. Her first exposure to music started at an early age when she would attend her sister's singing lessons with her mom. By the age of 2, she could sing 47 songs fluently. Yet she couldn't speak properly, but she would sing her way through.
            <br>
            <br>
            Traditional Polyphonic Singing was the first training that had a major influence on her understanding of the voice as an instrument to express oneself and later on her music.
            <br>
            <br>

            Besides singing, Nana was eager to explore herself through the different mediums of arts. 
        
            Dancing was another sphere that she got herself involved. Mastering her body, mind, and soul through the movements, was helpful to navigate the ruthless environment that she was growing up in. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            At the age of 14, she joined the film school <i>“Pionerfilm”</i> and became the head of the class. During her blooming years in film school, Nana directed various musical events and movies, which gave her enormous creative freedom to learn new skills and realize her dreams. <i>Pionerfilm</i> was the only place where Nana would escape into her own creative world. She says:
            <br>
            
            </p>
                <p class="qoute">
                    <i>“ During those years, I would be the teacher and a student, actor, and director, everyone and no one at the same time. Once I would enter the building I was in a magical world where I could be safe expressing myself through different shapes. It was what every child dreams of and I was indeed lucky to be part of the dream”</i>
                </p>
           
            
            <p class="bio-text text2">
             An endless array of irritation and obstacles due to economical and cultural situations affected her freedom of exploration. In her early teen years, Nana had to leave behind the creative world. After years and years of hard work, Nana decided to leave the country and moved to <i>Berlin</i> at the age of 21.
             <br>
            Reshaping her future intentionally in order to tap into the unknown gave her new possibilities to re-explore her creative freedom. After 8 years of break from music, she started to experiment with sound and voice once again. Leaving the cultural conscious behind and emerging into the unknown was the way for <b><i>nana.ios</i></b> to be born.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nana started to work on her first album during the years <i>2018 - 2022</i>. Wrote, recorded, and produced her own album and released <b><i>“The Way Of Joy”</i></b> on September <i>23, 2022</i>.
            <br>
             The album reshapes the cruelty and unfairness of the modern world with <i>Ethereal Dream Pop</i> sound. It tests boundaries in order to reflect and reconnect within the nature of human beings and beyond. Warm and playful <i>Synth Pop</i> sound unfolds itself into storytelling about the power of changes, the dynamic of growth, and the source of love in the realm of sparkly light bulbs, wrapped with the dreaminess of candy dust.
             <br>
             <br>
            The essential part of <b><i>nana.ios</i></b> is the archetypical journey into the sound of opposites, which is well captured by the various mixes of genres and her non-traditional approaches to pop music. 
            Channeling all the different mediums of art into the project is a new place for her to reflect on the world as it is and reshape the future for the better.
            The lyrical content of her songs is the conversation directly between the listener and herself. As it is guidance, prayer, and a map of the ways to joy.
